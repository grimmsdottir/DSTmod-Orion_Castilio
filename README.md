# DSTmod-Orion_Castilio
A Dont Starve Together mod featuring my OC

  Hello Dear Reader. This is my character mod for DST. If you are simply a casual player of DST, you should stick to the Steam
Workshop version instead, as that one will be stabler. However, if you are more hardcore, you can feel free to try the experimental
dev version over at https://github.com/grimmsdottir/DSTmod-Orion_Castilio/ . Do note that the dev version is highly unstable and prone
to not working at all.
